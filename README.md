# mounter-cli
ncurses based c++ program to mount/unmount devices quickly

## current state
I no longer use this app, but it is working on my setup (I somehow prefer doing this manually).
If you need some nice example of C++ program using ncurses
then this might give you all the necessary code samples.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/nagy135/mounter-cli  
cd mounter-cli  
make  


## Usage
switch to root or run with sudo  
  
sudo mounter-cli
